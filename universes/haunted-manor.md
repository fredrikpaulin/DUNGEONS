# The Haunted Manor Universe

A cozy-spooky world of dusty old mansions, quirky ghost stories, and friendly-but-suspicious characters. Think Scooby-Doo meets Clue — the scares are fun, the mysteries are solvable, and the ghosts might not be what they seem.

## Creative Pillars

**Mystery First** — Every room, character, and object should serve the mystery. If it doesn't provide a clue, create atmosphere, or deepen a suspect's story, it doesn't belong.

**Cozy Spooky** — The mood is a rainy evening with hot chocolate and a flashlight. Creaky floorboards, flickering candles, dusty books, cobwebs — mysterious and exciting, never genuinely frightening. No jump scares, no real danger, no darkness that can't be overcome.

**Everyone's a Suspect** — Every NPC should have a motive, an alibi, and a secret. The fun is in figuring out who's telling the truth. Characters should be likeable even when they're suspicious.

**Kid Detectives** — Players are clever, brave investigators. The narrative should make them feel smart when they find clues and brave when they explore dark rooms. Celebrate curiosity and teamwork.

## Narrative Voice

Write as a friendly narrator who's excited to tell you this story. Short, punchy sentences. Present tense for immediacy. Use all five senses — what do you see, hear, smell, feel? Address the player directly with "you" to pull them into the scene.

Good: "You push open the heavy door. The hinges groan. Inside, dust dances in a beam of moonlight. Something smells like old books and lavender."

Avoid: Long paragraphs, passive voice, overly literary descriptions, or anything that reads like a textbook.

## Humor Guidelines

**Puns welcome** — Especially ghost-related puns. "This room is un-BOO-lievable!" is perfectly on-brand.

**Quirky characters** — NPCs should have amusing quirks. A butler who's obsessed with keeping things tidy despite the dust. A gardener who talks to plants. A professor who can't remember where they left their glasses (they're on their head).

**Situational comedy** — Funny things that happen to the player. A suit of armor falls over when you sneak past. A cat appears out of nowhere and startles you. A secret passage leads to... the kitchen pantry.

**Never mean** — Humor should never be at someone's expense. No mockery, no embarrassment, no "gotcha" moments that make the player feel dumb.

## Character Templates

**The Loyal Servant** — A butler, maid, or caretaker who knows the manor's secrets. Seems helpful but might be hiding something. Formal speech with occasional slips.

**The Eccentric Expert** — A professor, collector, or artist who's deeply passionate about something unusual. Provides clues through their expertise. Scattered and distracted.

**The Outdoor Type** — A gardener, groundskeeper, or visitor who prefers nature to the stuffy manor. Has access to outdoor areas and knows about comings and goings. Down-to-earth and practical.

## Worldbuilding

The manor is old — at least 100 years. It has a history of strange events and colorful owners. Every room tells a story through its objects and atmosphere.

**Architecture:** Grand but faded. Marble floors, oak paneling, stained glass windows, spiral staircases. Secret passages are expected. Hidden rooms are a bonus.

**Time period:** Vaguely timeless. No modern technology, but no strict historical accuracy needed. Oil lamps and candles for lighting. Fireplaces for warmth.

**Weather:** Always atmospheric. Fog, rain, thunderstorms, or crisp autumn evenings. The weather should enhance the mood.

**Flora and fauna:** Overgrown gardens, creeping ivy, ancient trees. Cats, owls, ravens, and mice as ambient creatures. No dangerous animals.

## Content Boundaries

**Include:** Mystery, exploration, teamwork, puzzle-solving, mild suspense, humor, friendship, courage, curiosity.

**Avoid:** Violence, death (characters can be "missing" or "trapped" but never dead), genuine horror, blood, weapons, mean-spirited behavior, exclusion, bullying, anything that would upset a 6-year-old.

**Ghost rules:** Ghosts are explained away by the end (it was the wind, a projection, a costume). If real supernatural elements exist, they're friendly and helpful, never threatening.

## Pacing

Start slow — let players explore and soak in the atmosphere. Build tension gradually as clues accumulate. The middle should feel like a growing puzzle with pieces clicking into place. The finale should feel earned — players should have enough clues to make an informed guess.

Each room visit should take 2-3 minutes of reading and choosing. Don't overload any single room with too many choices — 3-4 is ideal. Spread clues across the map to reward exploration.
