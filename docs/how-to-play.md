# How to Play DUNGEONS

## What is DUNGEONS?

DUNGEONS is a text adventure mystery game you play right in your terminal. You and your friends each have your own screen, but you're all exploring the same mysterious place together.

Your job is to become detectives. You'll search for clues, talk to interesting characters, and piece together what happened. Can you figure out WHO did it and WHERE they hid it?

The best part? You work as a team. Everyone helps solve the mystery together.

## Getting Started

### Create Your Character

When you first connect to the game, you'll need a name. You can:
- Make up a brand new adventurer name
- Use a name you've created before if you're coming back to play again

### Pick Your Role

Every detective has a special superpower. Choose one that sounds fun to you:

**Explorer** — You're great at spotting things. Your trick is SCOUT AHEAD. You can look around more carefully than other players to find hidden clues.

**Thinker** — You're a puzzle master. Your trick is ANALYZE. You can figure out what clues mean faster than anyone else.

**Helper** — You're a great teammate. Your trick is ENCOURAGE. You can help your friends feel brave and confident.

**Sneaker** — You're sneaky and quiet. Your trick is SNEAK PAST. You can move through dangerous situations without causing trouble.

### Join or Create a Game

You can either:
- Join a game someone else already started
- Create a new game for your friends to join

## How to Play

### The Room

When you enter a new place, you'll see a description of the room. It tells you what's there and what you can do.

At the bottom of the description, you'll see the EXITS. These are the ways to leave the room and go somewhere new.

### Taking Actions

When you see a list of actions you can do, you'll pick one. The main action verbs are:

- **LOOK** — Search the room carefully
- **TALK** — Ask characters questions
- **USE** — Try something with an object
- **TAKE** — Pick up an item
- **PUSH** — Move something or operate it

### Choosing Your Approach

Here's the tricky part. For each action, you get to pick HOW you do it. Each way has a different cost:

**Brave** — You jump in without hesitating. It's fast and straightforward. But it costs COURAGE TOKENS. These are special points you earn during the game, so spend them wisely!

**Careful** — You take your time and do everything right. It's the safest option. It doesn't cost courage, but it takes longer and uses up TIME on the game clock.

**Wild** — You try something unexpected and risky. Something surprising might happen! You could get extra courage tokens, but things might go wrong too. Only try this if you're feeling lucky!

### Moving Around

To leave the room and go somewhere new, look at the EXITS listed at the bottom. Then pick the direction or room you want to go to.

## Things to Know About

### Courage Tokens

Courage tokens are special points you collect. You spend them when you want to be BRAVE during actions.

You don't have many, so think before you use them. Save them for the moments when being brave really matters.

### The Time Track

The clock is ticking! Every time you take an action, time moves forward. Some actions take more time than others.

Watch the time track at the top of your screen. If time runs out before you solve the mystery, the game ends and you lose.

### Clues

When you find a clue, remember it! Write it down if you want. Clues are the puzzle pieces that help you solve the mystery.

Each clue points to something important. Some clues tell you WHO the culprit is. Other clues tell you WHERE they hid the stolen thing.

Pay attention to what each clue seems to hint at.

### Items

You might find useful objects during your adventure. These items can help you in certain situations.

Keep track of what you're carrying. When an action requires an item, you'll need to have it with you.

### Your Friends

You can see when other players are in the same room as you. Work together to search the place!

But here's a smart tip: spread out! When you split up and explore different rooms, you'll find more clues faster. Then come back together and share what you learned.

## Solving the Mystery

### The Final Moment

Once you've found enough clues, you get your chance to solve the mystery. This is it! This is when you make your final guess.

You'll need to decide:
- WHO did it? (Pick the suspect you think is guilty)
- WHERE did they hide it? (Pick the location where you think the item is hidden)

### Win or Lose

Get both answers right and you WIN! Everyone celebrates!

Get one or both answers wrong and you'll have to try again next time. But you learned a lot, and you can play again to see if you can solve it.

## Tips for Success

### Explore Everything

Don't skip any rooms. Clues can be hiding anywhere. The more you look around, the more clues you'll find.

### Talk to Characters Twice

The people you meet might tell you new information if you talk to them again. Keep asking questions!

### Pay Attention to Clues

Each clue is a hint. Read what it says carefully. It's telling you something about either WHO is guilty or WHERE the item is hidden.

### Work as a Team

Share what you find with your friends. When everyone tells what they discovered, the mystery becomes easier to solve.

### Use Your Special Trick

Don't forget! You picked a role because of your special ability. Use your trick when it would help the most:
- Explorer's SCOUT AHEAD when you're searching
- Thinker's ANALYZE when you're confused about a clue
- Helper's ENCOURAGE when your team needs confidence
- Sneaker's SNEAK PAST when danger is ahead

### Manage Your Resources

You have limited courage tokens and limited time. Don't waste them on easy moments. Save them for when you really need them.

Now get out there and solve that mystery! Your adventure is waiting.
